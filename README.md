# Xealth Take Home

You are given a list of words sorted in alphabetical order. The only issue
is that this alphabet isn’t English. Can you determine the ordering of the
alphabet?

Note that you can assume the list of words will have enough information to
derive the complete order of the alphabet.

Input: ['bca','aaa','acb]<br />
Output: [‘b’, ‘a’, ‘c’]
